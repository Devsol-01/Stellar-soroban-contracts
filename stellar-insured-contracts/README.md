(Stellar Soroban Contracts – Insurance Logic)

Stellar Insured 🧠 — Soroban Smart Contracts

This repository contains the core insurance smart contracts for Stellar Insured, written using Stellar Soroban.
These contracts power policy issuance, claims processing, settlements, risk pools, and DAO governance in a fully decentralized and trustless manner.


They are intended for policyholders, DAO members, auditors, and developers who require transparent, immutable, and verifiable insurance logic deployed on the Stellar blockchain.


## Architecture

### 1. Policy Contract
Manages insurance policy issuance, renewal, and lifecycle.
- **Issue Policy**: Create new insurance policies with coverage amounts and premiums
- **Renew Policy**: Extend policy duration before expiry
- **Cancel Policy**: Policyholder can cancel active policies
- **Expire Policy**: Mark policies as expired



**Key Functions**:
- `initialize(admin, risk_pool)` - Initialize contract
- `issue_policy(holder, coverage_amount, premium_amount, duration_days, policy_type)` - Issue new policy
- `get_policy(policy_id)` - Retrieve policy details
- `renew_policy(policy_id, duration_days)` - Renew existing policy
- `cancel_policy(policy_id)` - Cancel policy
- `expire_policy(policy_id)` - Mark as expired
- `get_stats()` - Get contract statistics

### 2. Claims Contract
Processes insurance claims with deterministic multi-stage approval workflow.
- **Submit Claim**: Policyholders submit claims with evidence (Submitted status)
- **Start Review**: Admin moves claim to review stage (UnderReview status)
- **Approve/Reject Claim**: Admin approves valid claims or rejects invalid ones (Approved/Rejected status)
- **Settle Claim**: Release funds to claimant for approved claims only (Settled status)

**Multi-Stage Workflow**:
```
Submitted → UnderReview → Approved/Rejected → Settled (Approved only)
```

**State Transition Rules**:
- Only admin can transition claims between states
- Claims can only be settled if approved (prevents premature settlement)
- Full state validation prevents invalid transitions

**Key Functions**:
- `initialize(admin, policy_contract, risk_pool)` - Initialize contract
- `submit_claim(policy_id, amount)` - Submit new claim (sets status to Submitted)
- `start_review(claim_id)` - Admin moves claim to UnderReview status
- `get_claim(claim_id)` - Retrieve claim details with status
- `approve_claim(claim_id)` - Admin approves UnderReview claims (sets to Approved)
- `reject_claim(claim_id)` - Admin rejects UnderReview claims (sets to Rejected)
- `settle_claim(claim_id)` - Settle approved claims only, integrates with risk pool
- `get_stats()` - Get claims statistics

### 3. Risk Pool Contract
Manages liquidity pool for claims settlement.
- **Deposit Liquidity**: Providers deposit XLM to earn rewards
- **Withdraw Liquidity**: Withdraw staked amounts
- **Reserve Liquidity**: Lock funds for pending claims
- **Release Liquidity**: Return reserved funds after settlement

**Key Functions**:
- `initialize(admin, xlm_token, min_provider_stake)` - Initialize pool
- `deposit_liquidity(provider, amount)` - Deposit into pool
- `withdraw_liquidity(provider, amount)` - Withdraw from pool
- `payout_claim(recipient, amount)` - Pay out approved claims (admin only)
- `get_pool_stats()` - Pool statistics
- `get_provider_info(provider)` - Provider stake info

### 5. Slashing Contract
Professional on-chain slashing mechanism to penalize malicious or negligent actors.
- **Slashable Roles**: Oracle providers, claim submitters, governance participants, risk pool providers
- **Configurable Penalties**: DAO-controlled penalty percentages and multipliers
- **Fund Redirection**: Slashed funds redirected to risk pool, treasury, or compensation fund
- **Repeat Offender System**: Progressive penalties for multiple violations
- **Cooldown Periods**: Time-based protection against excessive slashing

**Key Functions**:
- `initialize(admin, governance_contract, risk_pool_contract)` - Initialize with governance integration
- `configure_penalty_parameters(role, reason, percentage, destination, multiplier, cooldown)` - Set penalty rules
- `slash_funds(target, role, reason, amount)` - Execute slashing with validation
- `add_slashable_role(role)` / `remove_slashable_role(role)` - Manage slashable roles
- `get_slashing_history(target, role)` - View violation history
- `get_violation_count(target, role)` - Check repeat offenses
- `can_be_slashed(target, role)` - Verify slashing eligibility
- `pause()` / `unpause()` - Emergency controls
### 4. Governance Contract
Professional DAO proposal system enabling decentralized protocol decisions.
- **Proposal Creation**: Create detailed proposals with title, description, and execution data
- **Voting Period Enforcement**: Strict time-based voting with configurable periods
- **Proposal Storage Schema**: Efficient storage using Soroban-compatible data structures
- **Read-only Queries**: Comprehensive query functions for proposal data and statistics

**Key Functions**:
- `initialize(admin, token_contract, voting_period_days, min_voting_percentage, min_quorum_percentage, slashing_contract)` - Initialize with quorum requirements
- `create_proposal(title, description, execution_data, threshold_percentage)` - Create detailed proposal
- `get_proposal(proposal_id)` - Retrieve full proposal details
- `vote(proposal_id, vote_weight, is_yes)` - Cast vote with duplicate prevention
- `finalize_proposal(proposal_id)` - Finalize after voting period with quorum/threshold checks
- `execute_proposal(proposal_id)` - Execute passed proposals
- `create_slashing_proposal(target, role, reason, amount, evidence, threshold)` - Create slashing proposals
- `execute_slashing_proposal(proposal_id)` - Execute approved slashing actions
- `get_active_proposals()` - Query all active proposals
- `get_proposal_stats(proposal_id)` - Get voting statistics
- `get_all_proposals()` - List all proposals
- `get_vote_record(proposal_id, voter)` - Check individual voting records

## Deployment

1. Build all contracts:
```bash
cd contracts/policy && cargo build --release
cd contracts/claims && cargo build --release
cd contracts/risk_pool && cargo build --release
cd contracts/governance && cargo build --release
```

2. Deploy to Stellar network using Soroban CLI

3. Initialize each contract with proper parameters

## Security Considerations

- **Authorization**: All sensitive operations require authentication
- **State Validation**: Comprehensive checks on contract state transitions
- **Error Handling**: Descriptive error codes for debugging
- **Event Logging**: All important actions emit events
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limits for production
